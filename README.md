# Poker Hand Sorter 

## Description
This task required me to build a backend application capable of taking data containing stream of poker hands via STDIN and determine the winner of each hand. The program is built simply with Javascript and Node.js. 

## Installation instructions
The application requires Node.js to run, please ensure that the latest version of Node is installed on your local machine.

## How to use the application
First, clone the repo onto your local machine. No npm installations are required for this application. To execute the app, navigate to the directory where 'pokerhandsorter.js' is stored and run `node pokerhandsorter.js`.

The application will then ask you to input the file path to the data you are wishing for it to read. To use the data supplied in this repo, simply type `poker-hands.txt`

This will run through the data and display the number of time Player One and Player Two win.
